**AWS Bedrock + Lambda + S3 + Amplify prototype for cross-hospital AI data summarization**


##  Inspiration
Working in a hospital, I‚Äôve seen how frustrating it can be when hospitals using the same EMR (like Epic Systems) still rely on fax machines to share patient orders and results. Faxes meet HIPAA standards, but they‚Äôre inefficient, delayed, and often lost ‚Äî leaving both patients and staff asking:  
> ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have your order ‚Äî do you have a paper copy?‚Äù

Patients also struggle to manage multiple MyChart logins across hospitals. Even with Epic‚Äôs ‚ÄúCare Everywhere,‚Äù sharing feels fragmented.  
**I AI (Integrated Intelligence)** was born from that challenge ‚Äî a prototype exploring *what if hospitals could securely connect and summarize cross-organizational data automatically*?

##  About the Prototype
**I AI** is a cloud-based agentic AI system designed to simulate intelligent healthcare data summarization using:
- **Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)** for reasoning and summarization  
- **AWS Lambda** for backend processing  
- **Amazon S3** for patient data storage  
- **AWS Amplify** for the web-based user interface  
- **FPDF** for generating downloadable reports  

The prototype shows how AI could unify fragmented patient data, summarize encounters, generate care summaries, and even produce printable PDF orders ‚Äî reducing phone calls, delays, and manual paperwork.

**Figure 1. I AI Healthcare Connector ‚Äî AWS Architecture Overview**

1. **Patients/Clinicians** interact through the **AWS Amplify** web app.  
2. **Amplify** sends requests to **AWS Lambda**, which processes and routes data.  
3. **S3** stores synthetic patient data (generated via Synthea).  
4. **AWS Lambda** interacts with **Amazon Bedrock** for AI-powered summaries and order verification.  
5. **FPDF** generates downloadable care summary PDFs.  
6. **IAM Roles**, **CloudTrail**, and **CloudWatch** ensure security, logging, and monitoring.

##  Technologies Used
| Category | Tools / Services |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Languages** | Python, HTML, JavaScript |
| **Cloud Services** | AWS Bedrock, AWS Lambda, S3, Amplify |
| **Frameworks** | FPDF (PDF generation), Pandas |
| **AI Model** | Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via Amazon Bedrock) |
| **APIs** | S3 File API, Lambda REST Endpoints |
| **Dataset** | Synthetic EMR data (Synthea-generated) |

---

##  How It Works
1. Patient data (JSON/CSV) is stored in an **S3 bucket**.  
2. The **Amplify** UI allows users to search, query, and request summaries.  
3. Requests go to **Lambda**, which:  
   - Fetches patient data from S3  
   - Sends context to **Bedrock (Claude 3.5)** for reasoning  
   - Returns readable insights and summaries  
4. Users can **download a PDF order report**, automatically generated by **FPDF**.

##  Accomplishments
- Built a working AI + cloud integration using AWS Bedrock and Lambda  
- Successfully deployed on Amplify with real-time response from Bedrock  
- Achieved a secure, role-based architecture using IAM, CloudTrail, and CloudWatch  

---

##  Challenges
- Configuring **CORS and Lambda permissions** for cross-service access  
- Managing large JSON/FHIR data while keeping Lambda layer under AWS limits  
- Simplifying the **user flow** between multiple AWS services  

---

##  What We Learned
- How to orchestrate multi-service AI pipelines in AWS  
- Best practices for managing serverless AI agents and cost optimization  
- Importance of UI clarity when demonstrating cloud-based AI prototypes  

---

##  What‚Äôs Next
- Integrate with **FHIR APIs** for real hospital data  
- Enable **Bedrock Agents with memory and reasoning primitives**  
- Add **multi-agent collaboration** between provider and patient views  
- Extend support to **Amazon Q** and **SageMaker endpoints**
